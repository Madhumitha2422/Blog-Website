 *steps to follow when creating a blog website using Flask:*

1. **Setup & Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Python (3.6+), Pip, and a text editor installed.
   - Basic knowledge of Python, Flask and HTML/CSS.

2. **Project Structure:**
   - Create a project directory.
   - Organize it with an 'app' directory, 'static' for CSS/JS, 'templates' for HTML, and a 'run.py' main script.

3. **Virtual Environment:**
   - Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
   - Activate it: `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux).

4. **Install Flask:**
   - Install Flask within the virtual environment: `pip install Flask`.

5. **Create Flask App:**
   - In `run.py`, create a basic Flask app.

6. **Database Setup:**
   - Choose a database system (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
